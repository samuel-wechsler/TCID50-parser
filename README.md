# TCID50-parser
## A cell image analysis tool for automated titration readout of endpoint dilution assays

This program was developed to improve the workflow for titration readout of endpoint dilution assays. It provides the following functionalities:
* Automated classification of fluorescence microscopy images of cell cultures using a convolutional neural network
* Manual classification of cell culture images
* Calculation of the Tissue-Culture-Infectious-Dose-50% (TCID50) using the Spearman-KÃ¤rber method
* Development of custom convolutional neural networks for automated classification of cell culture images, perhaps using transfer learning

## Getting started
To install this programm, you will need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Download the programm using git:
````
git clone https://github.com/samuel-wechsler/TCID50-parser.git
````

Pick up dependencies using pip:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

After the successfull installation, nagivate to the source directory and run:
`````
python TCID50_parser.py
`````

### Proof of Concept
Due to the failure of the convolutional neural network to generalize to new data, the program supports transfer learning to improve the perfomance of the model.

Perfomance before transfer learning:
`````
accuracy: 0.875
true positive: 1.0
true_negative: 0.8261
`````

Perfomance after transfer learning on 100 images:
`````
accuracy: 0.9792
true positive: 0.9630
true_negative: 0.9855
`````
